# High-Order Tomography

High-Order Tomography (HOT) is a prototype tool for inferring routing matrices from 
end-to-end data. This repository is the official code for 
[Topology Inference with Multivariate Cumulants: The MÃ¶bius Inference Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07880),
to appear in <i>IEEE / ACM Transactions on Networking</i>.
Documentation for the code is under development at https://high-order-tomography.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

Please note this is not quite a stable release. While the core algorithms are not expected to change, 
I am still ironing out the API and documentation.
